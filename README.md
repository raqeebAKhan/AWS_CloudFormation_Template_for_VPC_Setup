# AWS_CloudFormation_Template_for_VPC_Setup

This project showcases the development of an AWS CloudFormation template designed to automate the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with associated subnets, security groups, and route tables. The aim is to establish a secure and scalable network infrastructure in an efficient and reproducible manner.

Features
* Automated VPC Creation: Developed a CloudFormation template to automatically create a VPC with specified configurations.

* Subnet Definition: Defined subnets within the VPC to segregate resources across availability zones.

* Security Groups: Configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic flow.

* Route Tables: Established route tables for routing traffic between subnets and to external networks.
